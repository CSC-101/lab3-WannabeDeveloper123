# Double the value of a number.
# Input: a number to be doubled
# Result: a number
def double(n:int) -> int:
    result = n * 2
    return result

#answer to question listed in task 3: since it was n*n when we passed the first time,
#it is wrong to say that the code was correct. 2 tests were required here to check whether the function follows its intended purpose.
